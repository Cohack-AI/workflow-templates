# Digital Influencer (Twitter) Template

Kick-start a social automation workflow that drafts and publishes tweets using Cohack.

## What To Do Next

1. Install the SDK once available in your registry:
   ```bash
   npm install @cohack/client
   ```
2. Connect your Twitter/X integration credentials.
3. Implement the logic inside `src/workflow.ts` to create, schedule, and post content.
4. Adjust `cohack.config.ts` as you add more workflows or triggers.
5. Run `cohack deploy` to ship the workflow.
