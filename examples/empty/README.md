# Empty Cohack Workflow Template

This template is intentionally minimal so you can test the `cohack` CLI and SDK.

## Next Steps

1. Install the SDK (once it is published or linked locally):
   ```bash
   npm install @cohack/client
   ```
2. Replace the placeholder workflow in `src/workflow.ts` with your logic.
3. Update `cohack.config.ts` if you change file locations or add more workflows.
4. Run `cohack deploy` when you are ready to publish.

No dependencies are bundled so `npm install` completes instantly.
