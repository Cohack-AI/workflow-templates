# Email Automation Template

Use this scaffold to experiment with email-based Cohack workflows.

## Suggested Setup

1. Install required packages (the template ships without dependencies):
   ```bash
   npm install @cohack/client
   ```
2. Configure email provider credentials inside environment variables or secrets.
3. Flesh out `src/workflow.ts` with the automation steps you need.
4. Update `cohack.config.ts` with additional workflows or metadata.
5. Deploy when ready:
   ```bash
   cohack deploy
   ```
